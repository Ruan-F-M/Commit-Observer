# <center>What does this project do?</center>

It will check (in a list made by you!) wheter each user did <b> Commit to Github</b> today or not!

Then, it shall print a message formatted to Discord Bots/Webhooks tagging each person in the list, informing wheter they did or not commit today

>Currently using [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) to trigger this code everyday and send the message to a Discord server using a webhook

The output message should be something like this:

```
:no_entry_sign: <@76542112632143233> **DID NOT COMMIT** :no_entry_sign:
:white_check_mark: <@431348922175832044> **DID COMMIT** :white_check_mark:
```

This is what it looks like in Discord:


ðŸš« [@Silva]() **DID NOT COMMIT**ðŸš«  
âœ… [@Ruan]() **DID COMMIT**    âœ…


## <center>Why does this project exist?</center>

This project was made as a means to automate a bet made with my friends in an effort to increase our productivity, and now you can do the same with your friends (or by yourself)!

This project is designed to help you form a coding habit, and thus is best used with some form of additional drawback for not commiting (ex: x numbers of pushups).
> as per the fourth principle of breaking bad habits (make it unsatisfying), described in James Clear's Atomic Habits
